# tozti-night

tozti-night is a showcase of the modularity of the tozti project

It is a full extension that consists of only three files : `server.py`, `build.js` and `style.css`.

It does not require any compilation or installation : just put it into tozti's extension folder and it is ready to be used.

The functionality of tozti-night is to change tozti's theme to a more eye-friendly darker theme for the night. For that it adds a button on the upper header of tozti.
